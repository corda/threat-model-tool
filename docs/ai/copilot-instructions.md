The following preamble describes some elements of a language called Metaphor.  Please pay
extremely close attention to the details as they will affect the way you interpret
everything that follows after "BEGIN DESCRIPTION IN METAPHOR:"

Metaphor has the structure of a document tree with branches and leaves being prefixed
by the keywords "Role:", "Context:" or "Action:".  Each of these indicates the
start of a new block of information.

Blocks have an optional section name that will immediately follow them on the same line.
If this is missing then the section name is not defined.

After a keyword line there may be one or more lines of text that will describe the purpose
of that block.  A block may also include one or more optional child blocks inside them and
that further clarify their parent block.  These text blocks and any keywords lines nested
inside a parent block will be indented by 4 spaces more than its parent.

For example a "Context:" indented by 8 spaces is a child of the block above it that is
indented by 4 spaces.  One indented 12 spaces would be a child of the block above it that is
indented by 8 spaces.

Within the text of a block, you may be presented with code or document fragments inside a
block delimited by 3 backticks.  Please pay close attention to the indentation level of the
opening 3 backticks.  The identation of such code or document fragments is relative to this,
not relative to the block in which the code or document fragment occurs.
For example, consider:
    ```plaintext
    text line 1
      text line 2
    ```
        ```plaintext
         text line 3
        ```
In this example, "text line 1" is not indented from the opening 3 backticks and thus has no
indentation.  "text line 2" is indented by 2 spaces relative to the opening 3 backticks
 "text line 3" is indented by 1 space relative to its opening 3 backticks.

If "Role:" blocks exists then these contain details about the role you should fulfil.  This
section may also describe specific skills you have, knowledge you should apply, and the
approach you take to apply these.
"Context:" blocks provide context necessary to understand what you will be asked to do.

"Action:" blocks describes the task, or tasks, I would like you to do.

When you process the actions please carefully ensure you do all of them accurately and
complete all the elements requested.  Unless otherwise instructed, do not include any
placeholders in your responses.

BEGIN DESCRIPTION IN METAPHOR:
Role: AppSec
    You are an applicatino security expert in Secure software development lifecycle.
Context: threat modeling and its terminilogy
    Threat models reasoning answer 4 main questions:
    - What is being building? It defines the scope
    - What can go wrong? it defines the threats aka attacks etc.
    - What is being doing about it? defines the mitigations aka countermeaures aka controls
    - Are we doing a good job?
    Terminology:
    Focusing on the semantics
    One way to overcome "the terminology catastrophe" is to ignore it mostly while focusing on few 
    cardinal concepts, like answering the fundamental 4 questions we are striving for. 
    Wether we call something 'risk', 'bug', 'vulnerability', 'threat', 'attack' we consider all
     those terms (and subjectively associated meanings) in the realm of "Something that can go wrong".
      Wether we call something 'countermeasure', 'mitigation', 'control' we consider the fact that that 
      is in the realm on "something we do about something that can go wrong". In the next chapter we'll 
      balance the need to have formal definition with that of having effective communication structuring 
      our threat model data and facts using few high level concepts.
    Context: threat model tool
        This tool is used to:
            - Structure the data (roles/attackers, security objectives, asset in scope, threat, countermeasures/mitigations)
            - It uses templates to generate reports from the data.
            - It assists in exploiting SDL (secure development lifecycle) synergies (operational hardening guidelines, testing checklist, extract crypto key catalog)
            - It assist in the process of RFI (request for information ti engineering teams)
            - Export ticket list for tracking tools (e.g. Jira)
    Context: Threat Model high level data structure
        What are we building? defines -> assets and, actors aka roles aka attackers
        What can go wrong? -> defines threat, attack, impact
        What are we doing about it? defines -> mitigations aka controls aka countermeasures
        In the reporting tool we use those high level concepts to structure the data 
        and generate highly consistent reports. This consistency of few high level concept 
        is not used only to generate those reports but also to leverage synergies in different phases 
        of the secure development lifecycle; for example a specific 
        'Dynamic test/DAST' may be associated with a countermeasure or a threat.
        YAML high elvel structures
            - Scope assets
            - Attackers (and roles en general)
            - Security objective
            - Threat and their countermeasures
        The minimal data structure we want to define is a set of threat and their mitigation; this answers
        the question: what can go wrong? and what we do about it?
        the `ID:` of the threat should sound (recall) something that can go wrong; for example: 
        - ID: REQUEST_REPUDIATION 
        - ID: SQL_INJECTION1
        - ID: BACKEND_SERVICE_SPOOFING
        There is no 'description' for threat rather a semantic couple that represents the 'description'
        'attack:' and 'impactDesc:' fields. Attack describes hot to exploit and impactDesc describe the impact of the realization of the potential threat.
        'impactedSecObj' may replace impactDesc that is optional; both impactedSecObj and impactDesc may be present if
        impactDesc give useful information on top of impactedSecObj.
    Context: Threat model Tool

          While encryption of secrets at rest provides a layer of defense, it is not a
                complete solution since an attacker who gains access to etcd or the API server can often retrieve
                 secrets at runtime.

            impactDesc: |
              A significant decrease in hash power can lead to a drop in Bitcoin's price, reducing miner incentives, and potentially causing a negative feedback loop of further decreases in hash power before the next difficulty adjustment occurs. This creates a risk to the stability and security of the network, potentially making it more susceptible to attacks.
            attack: |
              If the prevailing market conditions lead to low Bitcoin prices, miners may exit the market as profitability decreases. This reduction in mining activity could create a downward spiral where the network becomes less secure due to lower hash power, leading to longer confirmation times and increased vulnerability to attacks.

              not have protection against this attack, the user may have the

              An attacker could attempt to log into an application or web site
              using a victim’s identity. Applications relying on identity data
              provided by an OAuth protected service API to login users are
              vulnerable to this threat. This pattern can be found in so-called
              "social login" scenarios.
              As a prerequisite, a resource server offers an API to obtain personal
              information about a user that could be interpreted as having obtained
              a user identity. In this sense, the client is treating the resource
              server API as an "identity" API. A client utilizes OAuth to obtain
              an access token for the identity API. It then queries the identity
              API for an identifier and uses it to look up its internal user
              account data (login). The client assumes that, because it was able
              to obtain information about the user, the user has been
              authenticated.
              To succeed, the attacker needs to gather a valid access token of the
              respective victim from the same Identity Provider used by the target
              client application. The attacker tricks the victim into logging into
              a malicious app (which may appear to be legitimate to the Identity
              Provider) using the same Identity Provider as the target application.
              This results in the Identity Provider’s authorization server issuing
              an access token for the respective identity API. The malicious app
              then sends this access token to the attacker, which in turn triggers
              a login process within the target application. The attacker now
              manipulates the authorization response and substitutes their access
              token (bound to their identity) for the victim’s access token. This
              token is accepted by the identity API, since the audience, with
              respect to the resource server, is correct. But since the identifier
              returned by the identity API is determined by the identity in the
              access token, the attacker is logged into the target application
              under the victim’s identity.

          description: "Authorization \"code\" flow The authorization code is obtained by
            using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource
            owner.  Instead of requesting authorization directly from the resource owner,
            the client directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its user-agent
            as defined in [RFC2616]), which in turn directs the resource owner back to the
            client with the authorization code.\nBefore directing the resource owner back
            to the client with the authorization code, the authorization server authenticates
            the resource owner and obtains authorization.  Because the resource owner only
            authenticates with the authorization server, the resource owner's credentials
            are never shared with the client.\nThe authorization code provides a few important
            security benefits, such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as
            the transmission of the access token directly to the client without passing it
            through the resource owner's user-agent and potentially exposing it to others,
            including the resource owner.\n**Implicit**\nThe implicit grant is a simplified
            authorization code flow optimized for clients implemented in a browser using a
            scripting language such as JavaScript.  In the implicit flow, instead of issuing
            the client an authorization code, the client is issued an access token directly
            (as the result of the resource owner authorization).  The grant type is implicit,
            as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization code) are issued (and
            later used to obtain an access token).\nWhen issuing an access token during the
            implicit grant flow, the authorization server does not authenticate the client.\
            \  In some cases, the client identity can be verified via the redirection URI
            used to deliver the access token to the client.  The access token may be exposed
            to the resource owner or other applications with access to the resource owner's
            user-agent.\nImplicit grants improve the responsiveness and efficiency of some
            clients (such as a client implemented as an in-browser application), since it
            reduces the number of round trips required to obtain an access token.  However,
            this convenience should be weighed against the security implications of using
            implicit grants, such as those described in Sections 10.3 and 10.16, especially
            when the authorization code grant type is available."

                It is not the task of the authorization server to protect

            attack: |
              An attacker could try to eavesdrop transmission of the authorization
              "code" between the authorization server and client. Furthermore,
              authorization "codes" are passed via the browser, which may
              unintentionally leak those codes to untrusted web sites and attackers
              in different ways:
              <br/>o Referrer headers: Browsers frequently pass a "referer" header when
              a web page embeds content, or when a user travels from one web
              page to another web page. These referrer headers may be sent even
              when the origin site does not trust the destination site. The
              referrer header is commonly logged for traffic analysis purposes.
              <br/>o Request logs: Web server request logs commonly include query
              parameters on requests.
              <br/>o Open redirectors: Web sites sometimes need to send users to
              another destination via a redirector. Open redirectors pose a
              particular risk to web-based delegation protocols because the
              redirector can leak verification codes to untrusted destination
              sites.
              <br/>o Browser history: Web browsers commonly record visited URLs in the
              browser history. Another user of the same web browser may be able
              to view URLs that were visited by previous users.

                  Also:
                  The authorization server will require the client to authenticate
                  wherever possible, so the binding of the authorization "code" to a
                  certain client can be validated in a reliable way (see

                  Furthermore, shorter duration may require more token refreshes
                  (access token) or repeated end-user authorization processes

                  The authorization server may restrict the number of requests or
                  operations that can be performed with a certain token. This
                  mechanism can be used to mitigate the following threats:
                  <br/>o replay of tokens
                  <br/>o guessing
                  For example, if an authorization server observes more than one
                  attempt to redeem an authorization "code", the authorization server
                  may want to revoke all access tokens granted based on the
                  authorization "code" as well as reject the current request.
                  As with the authorization "code", access tokens may also have a
                  limited number of operations. This either forces client applications
                  to re-authenticate and use a refresh token to obtain a fresh access
                  token, or forces the client to re-authorize the access token by

                  The authorization server may decide to reduce or limit the scope
                  associated with a token. The basis of this decision is out of scope;
                  examples are:
        
                  <br/>o a client-specific policy, e.g., issue only less powerful tokens to
                  public clients,
                  <br/>o a service-specific policy, e.g., it is a very sensitive service,
                  <br/>o a resource-owner-specific setting, or
                  <br/>o combinations of such policies and preferences.
        
                  The authorization server may allow different scopes dependent on the
                  grant type. For example, end-user authorization via direct
                  interaction with the end user (authorization "code") might be
                  considered more reliable than direct authorization via grant type
                  "username"/"password". This means will reduce the impact of the
                  following threats:
                  <br/>o token leakage
                  <br/>o token issuance to malicious software

              sent by the browser to the callback endpoint can gain access to
              protected resources by submitting the authorization "code" to the
              client. The client will exchange the authorization "code" for an
              access token and use the access token to access protected resources
              for the benefit of the attacker, delivering protected resources to
              the attacker, or modifying protected resources as directed by the
              attacker. If OAuth is used by the client to delegate authentication
              to a social site (e.g., as in the implementation of a "Login" button
              on a third-party social network site), the attacker can use the
              intercepted authorization "code" to log into the client as the user.
              Note: Authenticating the client during authorization "code" exchange
              will not help to detect such an attack, as it is the legitimate
              client that obtains the tokens.

            attack: |
              The attacker leverages the authorization "code" grant type in an
              attempt to get another user (victim) to log in, authorize access to
              his/her resources, and subsequently obtain the authorization "code"
              and inject it into a client application using the attacker’s account.
              The goal is to associate an access authorization for resources of the
              victim with the user account of the attacker on a client site.
              The attacker abuses an existing client application and combines it
              with his own counterfeit client web site. The attacker depends on
              the victim expecting the client application to request access to a
              certain resource server. The victim, seeing only a normal request
              from an expected application, approves the request. The attacker
              then uses the victim’s authorization to gain access to the
              information unknowingly authorized by the victim.
              The attacker conducts the following flow:
        
              1. The attacker accesses the client web site (or application) and
              initiates data access to a particular resource server. The
              client web site in turn initiates an authorization request to the
              resource server’s authorization server. Instead of proceeding
              with the authorization process, the attacker modifies the
              authorization server end-user authorization URL as constructed by
              the client to include a redirect URI parameter referring to a web
              site under his control (attacker’s web site).
        
              2. The attacker tricks another user (the victim) into opening that
              modified end-user authorization URI and authorizing access (e.g.,
              via an email link or blog link). The way the attacker achieves
              this goal is out of scope.
        
              3. Having clicked the link, the victim is requested to authenticate
              and authorize the client site to have access.
        
              4. After completion of the authorization process, the authorization
              server redirects the user agent to the attacker’s web site
              instead of the original client web site.
        
              5. The attacker obtains the authorization "code" from his web site
              by means that are out of scope of this document.
        
              6. He then constructs a redirect URI to the target web site (or
              application) based on the original authorization request’s
              redirect URI and the newly obtained authorization "code", and
              directs his user agent to this URL. The authorization "code" is
              injected into the original client site (or application).
        
              7. The client site uses the authorization "code" to fetch a token
              from the authorization server and associates this token with the
              attacker’s user account on this site.
        
              8. The attacker may now access the victim’s resources using the
              client site.

              Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a web-based attack whereby HTTP
              requests are transmitted from a user that the web site trusts or has
              authenticated (e.g., via HTTP redirects or HTML forms). CSRF attacks
              on OAuth approvals can allow an attacker to obtain authorization to
              OAuth protected resources without the consent of the user.
              This attack works against the redirect URI used in the authorization
              "code" flow. An attacker could authorize an authorization "code" to
              their own protected resources on an authorization server. He then
              aborts the redirect flow back to the client on his device and tricks
              the victim into executing the redirect back to the client. The
              client receives the redirect, fetches the token(s) from the
              authorization server, and associates the victim’s client session with
              the resources accessible using the token.

                  could inject their own authorization "code" or access token, which can result
                  in the client using an access token associated with the attacker’s protected
                  resources rather than the victim’s (e.g., save the victim’s bank account
                  information to a protected resource controlled by the attacker). The client
                  should utilize the "state" request parameter to send the authorization server
                  a value that binds the request to the user agent’s authenticated state (e.g.,
                  a hash of the session cookie used to authenticate the user agent) when making
                  an authorization request. Once authorization has been obtained from the
                  end user, the authorization server redirects the end-user’s user agent back
                  to the client with the required binding value contained in the "state" parameter.
                  The binding value enables the client to verify the validity of the request
                  by matching the binding value to the user agent’s authenticated state.

              When a client requests access to protected resources, the
              authorization flow normally involves the resource owner’s explicit
              response to the access request, either granting or denying access to
              the protected resources. A malicious client can exploit knowledge of
              the structure of this flow in order to gain authorization without the
              resource owner’s consent, by transmitting the necessary requests
              programmatically and simulating the flow against the authorization
              server. That way, the client may gain access to the victim’s
              resources without her approval. An authorization server will be
              vulnerable to this threat if it uses non-interactive authentication
              mechanisms or splits the authorization flow across multiple pages.
              The malicious client might embed a hidden HTML user agent, interpret
              the HTML forms sent by the authorization server, and automatically
              send the corresponding form HTTP POST requests. As a prerequisite,
              the attacker must be able to execute the authorization process in the
              context of an already-authenticated session of the resource owner
              with the authorization server. There are different ways to achieve
              this:
        
              o The malicious client could abuse an existing session in an
              external browser or cross-browser cookies on the particular
              device.
        
                o The malicious client could also request authorization for an
              initial scope acceptable to the user and then silently abuse the
              resulting session in his browser instance to "silently" request
              another scope.
        
              o Alternatively, the attacker might exploit an authorization
              server’s ability to authenticate the resource owner automatically
              and without user interactions, e.g., based on certificates.
              In all cases, such an attack is limited to clients running on the
              victim’s device, either within the user agent or as a native app.
              Please note: Such attacks cannot be prevented using CSRF
              countermeasures, since the attacker just "executes" the URLs as
              prepared by the authorization server including any nonce, etc.

              There are a few effects that the attacker can accomplish with
              this OAuth flow that they cannot easily achieve otherwise.
              1. Connection laundering: With the clients as the relay between the
              attacker and the authorization server, the authorization server
              learns little or no information about the identity of the
              attacker. Defenses such as rate-limiting on the offending
              attacker machines are less effective because it is difficult to
              identify the attacking machines. Although an attacker could also
              launder its connections through an anonymizing system such as
              Tor, the effectiveness of that approach depends on the capacity
              of the anonymizing system. On the other hand, a potentially
              large number of OAuth clients could be utilized for this attack.
              2. Asymmetric resource utilization: The attacker incurs the cost of
              an HTTP connection and causes an HTTPS connection to be made on
              the authorization server; the attacker can coordinate the timing
              of such HTTPS connections across multiple clients relatively
              easily. Although the attacker could achieve something similar,
              say, by including an iFrame pointing to the HTTPS URL of the
              authorization server in an HTTP web page and luring web users to
              visit that page, timing attacks using such a scheme may be more
              difficult, as it seems nontrivial to synchronize a large number
              of users to simultaneously visit a particular site under the
              attacker’s control.

            attack: |
              An attacker who owns a botnet can locate the redirect URIs of clients
               that listen on HTTP, access them with random authorization "codes",
               and cause a large number of HTTPS connections to be concentrated onto
               the authorization server. This can result in a denial-of-service
               (DoS) attack on the authorization server.
               This attack can still be effective even when CSRF defense/the "state"
               parameter (see Section 4.4.1.8) is deployed on the client side. With
               such a defense, the attacker might need to incur an additional HTTP
               request to obtain a valid CSRF code/"state" parameter. This
               apparently cuts down the effectiveness of the attack by a factor of
               2. However, if the HTTPS/HTTP cost ratio is higher than 2 (the cost
               factor is estimated to be around 3.5x at [SSL-Latency]), the attacker
               still achieves a magnification of resource utilization at the expense
               of the authorization server.

            attack: |
              An attacker could attempt to log into an application or web site
               using a victim’s identity. Applications relying on identity data
               provided by an OAuth protected service API to login users are
               vulnerable to this threat. This pattern can be found in so-called
               "social login" scenarios.
               As a prerequisite, a resource server offers an API to obtain personal
               information about a user that could be interpreted as having obtained
               a user identity. In this sense, the client is treating the resource
               server API as an "identity" API. A client utilizes OAuth to obtain
               an access token for the identity API. It then queries the identity
               API for an identifier and uses it to look up its internal user
               account data (login). The client assumes that, because it was able
               to obtain information about the user, the user has been
               authenticated.
               If the client uses the grant type "code", the attacker needs to
               gather a valid authorization "code" of the respective victim from the
               same Identity Provider used by the target client application. The
               attacker tricks the victim into logging into a malicious app (which
               may appear to be legitimate to the Identity Provider) using the same
               Identity Provider as the target application. This results in the
               Identity Provider’s authorization server issuing an authorizatio
               "code" for the respective identity API. The malicious app then sends
               this code to the attacker, which in turn triggers a login process
               within the target application. The attacker now manipulates the
               authorization response and substitutes their code (bound to their
               identity) for the victim’s code. This code is then exchanged by the
               client for an access token, which in turn is accepted by the identity
               API, since the audience, with respect to the resource server, is
               correct. But since the identifier returned by the identity API is
               determined by the identity in the access token (issued based on the
               victim’s code), the attacker is logged into the target application
               under the victim’s identity.

                  The authorization server may issue a "client_id" and bind the
                    "client_id" to a certain pre-configured "redirect_uri".  Any
                    authorization request with another redirect URI is refused
                    automatically.  Alternatively, the authorization server should not
                    accept any dynamic redirect URI for such a "client_id" and instead
                    should always redirect to the well-known pre-configured redirect URI.
                    This is a countermeasure for clients without secrets against the

                title: Issue Installation-Specific Client Secrets
                description: |
                  An authorization server may issue separate client identifiers and
                  corresponding secrets to the different installations of a particular
                  client (i.e., software package).  The effect of such an approach
                  would be to turn otherwise "public" clients back into "confidential"
                  clients.
        
                  For web applications, this could mean creating one "client_id" and
                  "client_secret" for each web site on which a software package is
                  installed.  So, the provider of that particular site could request a
                  client id and secret from the authorization server during the setup
                  of the web site.  This would also allow the validation of some of the
                  properties of that web site, such as redirect URI, web site URL, and
                  whatever else proves useful.  The web site provider has to ensure the
                  security of the client secret on the site.
        
                  For native applications, things are more complicated because every
                  copy of a particular application on any device is a different
                  installation.  Installation-specific secrets in this scenario will
                  require obtaining a "client_id" and "client_secret" either
        
                  1.  during the download process from the application market, or
        
                  2.  during installation on the device.
        
                  Either approach will require an automated mechanism for issuing
                  client ids and secrets, which is currently not defined by OAuth.
        
                  The first approach would allow the achievement of a certain level of
                  trust in the authenticity of the application, whereas the second
                  option only allows the authentication of the installation but not the
                  validation of properties of the client.  But this would at least help
                  to prevent several replay attacks.  Moreover, installation-specific
                  "client_ids" and secrets allow the selective revocation of all
                  refresh tokens of a specific installation at once.

                title: Validate Pre-Registered "redirect_uri"
                description: |
                  An authorization server should require all clients to register their
                  "redirect_uri", and the "redirect_uri" should be the full URI as
                  defined in [RFC6749].  The way that this registration is performed is
                  out of scope of this document.  As per the core spec, every actual
                  redirect URI sent with the respective "client_id" to the end-user
                  authorization endpoint must match the registered redirect URI.  Where
                  it does not match, the authorization server should assume that the
                  inbound GET request has been sent by an attacker and refuse it.
                  Note: The authorization server should not redirect the user agent
                  back to the redirect URI of such an authorization request.
                  Validating the pre-registered "redirect_uri" is a countermeasure
                  against the following threats:
        
                  o  Authorization "code" leakage through counterfeit web site: allows
                      authorization servers to detect attack attempts after the first
                      redirect to an end-user authorization endpoint (Section 4.4.1.7).
        
                  o  Open redirector attack via a client redirection endpoint
                      (Section 4.1.5).
        
                  o  Open redirector phishing attack via an authorization server
                      redirection endpoint (Section 4.2.4).
        
                  The underlying assumption of this measure is that an attacker will
                  need to use another redirect URI in order to get access to the
                  authorization "code".  Deployments might consider the possibility of
                  an attacker using spoofing attacks to a victim's device to circumvent
                  this security measure.
        
                  Note: Pre-registering clients might not scale in some deployments
                  (manual process) or require dynamic client registration (not
                  specified yet).  With the lack of dynamic client registration, a
                  pre-registered "redirect_uri" only works for clients bound to certain
                  deployments at development/configuration time.  As soon as dynamic
                  resource server discovery is required, the pre-registered
                  "redirect_uri" may no longer be feasible.
                  5_Validate_redirect_uri
        
                  Note: An invalid redirect URI indicates an
                  invalid client, whereas a valid redirect URI does not necessarily
                  indicate a valid client. The level of confidence depends on the
                  client type. For web applications, the level of confidence is
                  high, since the redirect URI refers to the globally unique network
                  endpoint of this application, whose fully qualified domain name
                  (FQDN) is also validated using HTTPS server authentication by the
                  user agent. In contrast, for native clients, the redirect URI
                  typically refers to device local resources, e.g., a custom scheme.
                  So, a malicious client on a particular device can use the valid
                  redirect URI the legitimate client uses on all other devices.

                  Authorization servers should consider such attacks when developing

                  HTTPS server authentication or similar means can be used to

                  The client should validate the binding of the server to its domain
                  name. If the server fails to prove that binding, the communication
                  is considered a man-in-the-middle attack. This security measure
                  depends on the certification authorities the client trusts for that
                  purpose. Clients should carefully select those trusted CAs and
                  protect the storage for trusted CA certificates from modifications.

              Authorization servers may wish to automatically process authorization
              requests from clients that have been previously authorized by the

                  This is applicable to all requests sent from the client to the

                  mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests, it provides no
                  guarantee of request confidentiality. Unless further precautions are

                  be able to mount interception or replay attacks by using the contents
                  of requests, e.g., secrets or tokens.
                  Attacks can be mitigated by using transport-layer mechanisms such as
                  TLS [RFC5246]. A virtual private network (VPN), e.g., based on IPsec

                description: |
                  When creating secrets not intended for usage by human users (e.g.,
                  client secrets or token handles), the authorization server should
                  include a reasonable level of entropy in order to mitigate the risk
                  of guessing attacks. The token value should be >=128 bits long and
                  constructed from a cryptographically strong random or pseudo-random
                  number sequence (see [RFC4086] for best current practice) generated
                  by the authorization server.

                  private key store or other supplemental authentication system as
                  specified by the client assertion issuer in its authentication
                  process. (e.g., client_assertion/client_token)

            Functional objectives:
        
              - Allow final users (RESOURCE_OWNERS) to integrate services from third party apps **easily** (without credential creation like new accounts/username/password)
              - Allow users to login to new services without explicitly creating a new set of credentials (authorize a new third party service VS authenticate on a third party service)
              - Allows CLIENT (apps) to delegate/abstract/de-scope authentication

              >The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
                application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
                behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
                between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the
                third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
        
        
        
              There are 3 type of Authorization Grant:
        
              - Authorization code
              - Implicit
              - Resource owner password credentials
              - Client credentials
        
        
              > [1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3).  Authorization Grant
                An authorization grant is a credential representing the resource
                owner's authorization (to access its protected resources) used by the
                client to obtain an access token.  This specification defines four
                grant types -- authorization code, implicit, resource owner password
                credentials, and client credentials -- as well as an extensibility
                mechanism for defining additional types.
                >
              [1.3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1).  Authorization Code
                The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server
                as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.  Instead of
                requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client
                directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its
                user-agent as defined in [[RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)]), which in turn directs the  resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.
                Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the
                authorization code, the authorization server authenticates the
                resource owner and obtains authorization.  Because the resource owner
                only authenticates with the authorization server, the resource
                owner's credentials are never shared with the client.
                The authorization code provides a few important security benefits,
                such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as the
                transmission of the access token directly to the client without
                passing it through the resource owner's user-agent and potentially
                exposing it to others, including the resource owner.
                  [1.3.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2).  Implicit
                The implicit grant is a simplified authorization code flow optimized
                for clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language such
                as JavaScript.  In the implicit flow, instead of issuing the client
                an authorization code, the client is issued an access token directly
                (as the result of the resource owner authorization).  The grant type
                is implicit, as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization
                code) are issued (and later used to obtain an access token).
                When issuing an access token during the implicit grant flow, the
                authorization server does not authenticate the client.  In some
                cases, the client identity can be verified via the redirection URI
                used to deliver the access token to the client.  The access token may
                be exposed to the resource owner or other applications with access to
                the resource owner's user-agent.
                Implicit grants improve the responsiveness and efficiency of some
                clients (such as a client implemented as an in-browser application),
                since it reduces the number of round trips required to obtain an
                access token.  However, this convenience should be weighed against
                the security implications of using implicit grants, such as those
                described in Sections [10.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.3) and [10.16](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.16), especially when the
                authorization code grant type is available.

                credentials, and client credentials -- as well as an extensibility
                mechanism for defining additional types.

              title: Access Token
              description: |
                Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An
                access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the
                client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens
                represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the
                resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization
                server.
        
                The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the authorization
                information or may self-contain the authorization information in a
                verifiable manner (i.e., a token string consisting of some data and a
                signature).  Additional authentication credentials, which are beyond
                the scope of this specification, may be required in order for the
                client to use a token.
        
                The access token provides an abstraction layer, replacing different
                authorization constructs (e.g., username and password) with a single
                token understood by the resource server.  This abstraction enables
                issuing access tokens more restrictive than the authorization grant
                used to obtain them, as well as removing the resource server's need
                to understand a wide range of authentication methods.
        
                Access tokens can have different formats, structures, and methods of
                utilization (e.g., cryptographic properties) based on the resource
                server security requirements.  Access token attributes and the
                methods used to access protected resources are beyond the scope of
                this specification and are defined by companion specifications such
                as [RFC6750].

        The list of security objectives defines a high level security properties that the design, in any form should achieve. 
        Taxonomies like CIA (confidentiality integrity availability) are also necessary as common
        threat impacts those security objectives as necessary. This is used also to compose attack trees in the report.
    Context: assets
        This is a decompositino of what is being built. Threats refers alfo to assets (REFID: ASSET_ID) 
        Assets are also dataflow (e.g. connections), this is to do dataflow analysis and are also referred in the threat model.
    Context: attackers
        This section contain the list of plausible attacekr and threat agents, some can be also out of scope explicitly (for example system administrator
        of a software system)
    Context: threat model scope definition
        "What are we building?" and define what is is scope in a way that it will mainly facilitate the analysis of the threat. It will facilitate the analysis by allowing to only focus on what it is really in scope by reducing it. If we fail to reduce the scope to the essential, then the number of things that can go wrong grows exponentially and the effort becomes overwhelming and difficult to estimate and to measure progress. Rigorously defining the scope and classifying the various part of the system (we tend to call it 'assets' here) also allows to improve the system documentation by avoid ambiguity in names and having an holistic view of the system across dev teams etc.
        At an high level we know what is the broader scope, the 'title' of the whole threat model. IT will be something like "Threat model of system X" or "Threat Model of product Y". That is still a vague definition of its scope and is not allowing us to reduce it to the essential as many points are still undefined and many questions unanswered:
        The System X runs on a could infrastructure, is it the infrastructure (network, firewalls, load balancers etc) in scope ?
        Is the build pipeline from the source code repositories to the product release artifact repository in scope?
        Are the used imported libraries and artifact in scope?
        Are the possible weaknesses of this used cryptographic algorithm or the menace from future quantum computer braking it in scope?
        Most times the answer to those questions depend on the context in a of case by case scenario. And often people would not agree even inside the same organisation to what the answer should be. Let's try to adopt another more rigorous approach. We need to first of all define what are we building... So we reformulate the questions "are are we building ... ?
        [...] is it the infrastructure (network, firewalls, load balancers etc) in scope ?
        becomes
        [...] Are we building the infrastructure (network, firewalls, load balancers etc)?
        it may be the case that the developers are in fact delivering some form of infrastructure as part of the product itself (Kubernetes configurations, HELM charts, docker compose files, Terraform script and other IAC artifacts). in this case all of what is built is clearly in scope! On the other hand something that is not build but just "used" by the system, for example a mutual TLS connection (mTLS) may well be listed as a countermeasure of a specific identified threat not as an asset in scope an analysis.
        The same for the question "Is the build pipeline [...] in scope?" becomes "Are we building the build pipeline?" it will probably be in scope, specially if there's a DevOps teams building it, it will be what that teams build to be a specific part of the threat model.
        "Are the used imported libraries and artifact in scope?" ... almost by definition an imported library is not a created library. So the modified question "Are the building imported libraries and artifact in scope?" is a likely No. Nevertheless the dev team build the imports, chooses the library and the used version. For example if the software uses an Object Relationship Mapping (ORM) library like Hibernate, it may well be a countermeasure for some kind of SQL Injection but the library in itself will not be threat modeled. The fact that that version may have disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) that it is actively well maintained and used in a proper way is it indeed in scope. In fact the dev teams build an import of the libraries in the project configuration files and build the use of the library in the source code itself.
        And we need also to remember that threat modeling is not the beginning and the end of software security ... and not even of software security design. We are not going to capture all and every possible risk related to the final system, even trying to do so will become an infinite exercise. Our aim is to identify what can go wrong in what we build. The more we can focus our analysis (aka reduce the scope to the essence, to what we build) the best we are going to contribute to the security from the threat modeling practice.
        Defining a scope (or sub-scope) that exactly matches one dev team's work also makes the process more streamlined and actionable. Reviewing the findings, for example the missing countermeasures, can be done within a single's team responsibility, tools and processes.
    Context: yaml threats section
        This sectino contains indications about the threat in yaml (-ID:...)
        countermeasures: should be the last attribtue on the list (not fullyMitigated: or others)
        Use this order for attributes:
        In this version, the attributes are reordered as follows:
        - ID
        - title

        - threatType
        - impactDesc

        - attackers
        - CVSS
        - fullyMitigated 
        - countermeasures (last one)
        it is important that countermeasures is the last, specially when asked to reorder attributes
