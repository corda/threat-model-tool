    attack: |
      A hostile party could take advantage of this
      by intercepting the client's requests and returning misleading or
      otherwise incorrect responses.  This could be achieved using DNS or
      Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing.  Wide deployment of OAuth
      and similar protocols may cause users to become inured to the
      practice of being redirected to web sites where they are asked to
      enter their passwords.  If users are not careful to verify the
      authenticity of these web sites before entering their credentials, it
      will be possible for attackers to exploit this practice to steal
      users' passwords.

        description: |
          Authorization servers should consider such attacks when developing
          services based on OAuth and should require the use of transport-
          layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the
          authorization server or of request responses is an issue (see
          Section 5.1.2).

          Authorization servers should attempt to educate users about the
          risks posed by phishing attacks and should provide mechanisms that
          make it easy for users to confirm the authenticity of their sites.
